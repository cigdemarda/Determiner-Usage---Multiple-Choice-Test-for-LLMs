Using Gemma 3, Llama 3.2 and Phi 4 via [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) for evaluating these models' abilities of detecting grammatical or ungrammatical Noun Phrases, alongside with the ability of providing the correct form of the Noun Phrase.

This project connects to an LM Studio server for running models.
By default, it assumes LM Studio is running locally with the default API server. 
This setup is flexible: it's adabtable to other providers (such as Hugging Face, OpenAI, or Anthropic) by adjusting the API URL (and API key, if required).
